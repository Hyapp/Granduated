  abstract      = {Let $T=(A,M,0,B)$ be a triangular matrix algebra with its corner algebras $A$ and $B$ Artinian and $_AM_B$ an $A$-$B$-bimodule. The 2-recollement structures for singularity categories and Gorenstein defect categories over $T$ are studied. Under mild assumptions, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the existences of 2-recollements of singularity categories and Gorenstein defect categories over $T$ relative to those of $A$ and $B$. Parts of our results strengthen and unify the corresponding work in [27,28,34].},

  abstract = {Let \$M{\textbackslash}subset{\textbackslash}mathbb\{C\}{\textasciicircum}\{n+1\}\$ be a smooth affine hypersurface defined by the equation \$xy+p(z\_1,{\textbackslash}cdots,z\_\{n-1\})=1\$, where \$p\$ is a Brieskorn-Pham polynomial and \$n{\textbackslash}geq2\$. We prove that if \$L{\textbackslash}subset M\$ is an orientable exact Lagrangian submanifold, then \$L\$ does not admit a Riemannian metric with non-positive sectional curvature. The key point of the proof is to establish a version of homological mirror symmetry for the wrapped Fukaya category of \$M\$, from which the finite-dimensionality of the symplectic cohomology group \${\textbackslash}mathit\{SH\}{\textasciicircum}0(M)\$ follows by a Hochschild cohomology computation.},

  abstract = {The aim of this paper is to present some methods of constructions of semigroups by using the structure theory of semigroups within the class of regular semigroups, the quasi-regular of semigroups and also in the class of abundant semigroups. In particular, some basic notations and structure theorems of some well known semi-groups are exhibited. For example, the Rees matrix semigroups over the 0-group G 0 and its generalizations,bands, E-ideal quasi-regular semigroups, C *-quasiregular semigroups, L *-inverse semigroups and Q *-inverse semigroups.},
